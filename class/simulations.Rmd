1. Generate future rt's

No = current population 

N1 = lambdat * No

N2 = e^rt*N1

```{r}
#function takes mu, sigma, N0 and time horizon and loops through the entire 

simulateSEG

#if mu is negative, we expect to see a decline 
#if sigma has a value, adds variability 

simulateSEG(-0.01, 0.05, 100, 10)


```

Notes:
rnorm generates normally distrubted random numbers
SEG will never predict zero because lambda needs to be zero, which would make the growth rate (due to logs) negative infinity. That will never be drawn from the rnorm function 

Applying to grizzlies
```{r}
simulateSEG(mu = -0.013, sigma2 = .003, N0 = 40, time_horizon = 20)
```
